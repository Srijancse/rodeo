askForPythonCommand: What is the command that you use to run python?
explainAnaconda: |
  Anaconda is a packaged version of python that we recommend.  It includes most of the libraries used for common data
  science tasks, such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`
explainJupyter: |
  Rodeo relies on an open source package called
  [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/how_jupyter_ipython_work.html) for running
  interactive code, tab completion, and code introspection.
explainPandas: |
  [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use
  data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.
explainScipy: |
  [SciPy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy) (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is open-source software for mathematics, science,
  and engineering.
explainNumpy: |
  [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

  - a powerful N-dimensional array object
  - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
  - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
  - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

  Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of
  generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate
  with a wide variety of databases.
explainMatplotlib: |
  [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures
  in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. You can generate plots, histograms,
  power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts, scatterplots, etc, with just a few lines of code.
